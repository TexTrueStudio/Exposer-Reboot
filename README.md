# Exposer-Legacy

Have you ever wanted, to use Refined Storage together with another storage system? Now it is possible! Exposer adds one block to the game: The Exposer. 

You can connect an exposer to you Refined Storage system and it will expose the entire contents of the RS system as an inventory. 

You can attach a Storage Bus from Applied Energistics or similar equivalents from other mods to the exposer to access you Refined Storage system.
